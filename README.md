# Accident-Severity-Prediction-Model
This project analyzes factors leading to road accidents and traffic congestion using the "US Accidents" dataset. Focusing on 6 New England states, it predicts accident severity (1-4) based on 47 variables like road conditions, weather, and traffic signals. The goal is to build a prediction model prioritizing impactful explanatory variables.
